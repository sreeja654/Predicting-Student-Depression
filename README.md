This project focuses on predicting student depression using machine learning techniques. With mental health challenges increasingly affecting students due to factors such as academic pressure, financial stress, sleep deprivation, and personal circumstances, early identification of at-risk individuals is critical. The dataset includes over 25,000 student records with features like age, gender, CGPA, study satisfaction, dietary habits, and more. Through exploratory data analysis and both supervised and unsupervised learning models, the project aims to classify students likely to experience depression. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods like boosting and stacking are applied and evaluated. The project not only highlights key predictors of depression but also emphasizes the importance of mental health support in academic environments. This work serves as a foundation for developing data-driven interventions in student mental health care.

To ensure the integrity of the analysis, thorough data preprocessing was performed, including handling missing values, outlier treatment, and feature encoding. Visualizations were used extensively to explore correlations and gain insights into behavioral patterns associated with depressive symptoms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to measure model performance and guide tuning decisions. Additionally, clustering methods helped uncover latent patterns within the student population, enabling more targeted mental health strategies based on group characteristics.
